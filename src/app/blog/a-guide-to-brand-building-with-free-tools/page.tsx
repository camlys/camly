                            A brand is more than just a logo; it's the entire experience your customers have with your company. A strong brand builds trust, recognition, and loyalty. Hereâ€™s how you can use free tools to build yours.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>1. Define Your Visual Identity with a Favicon</h2>
                        <p>
                            Your website is often the first impression a customer has of your brand. A unique favicon is a small but critical detail that makes your site recognizable in a crowded browser tab. Use a <Link href="/apps/2" className="text-primary hover:underline">Favicon Generator</Link> to create one from your logo, an emoji, or text.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>2. Engage Customers with QR Codes</h2>
                        <p>
                            QR codes are a fantastic free tool for bridging your physical and digital marketing. Use a <Link href="/apps/0" className="text-primary hover:underline">QR & Barcode Generator</Link> to:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Link product packaging to your website.</li>
                            <li>Add a digital element to your business cards.</li>
                            <li>Offer contactless menus or information.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>3. Maintain Professionalism with PDF Tools</h2>
                        <p>
                           Every document you send is a reflection of your brand. Whether it's an invoice, a contract, or a report, it needs to look professional. Use a free tool like <Link href="/apps/4" className="text-primary hover:underline">PDFpro</Link> to edit, merge, and manage your documents with ease, ensuring brand consistency across all communications.
                        </p>

                        <h2>4. Optimize Your Visuals with an Image Resizer</h2>
                        <p>
                            A slow website can harm your brand's reputation. Large, unoptimized images are a common cause of slow load times. An <Link href="/apps/3" className="text-primary hover:underline">Image Resizer</Link> is essential for ensuring your website is fast, responsive, and professional.
                        </p>
